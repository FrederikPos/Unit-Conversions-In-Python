# Converting Units in Python
This is a python command line program where you can convert units such as Celsius to Fahrenheit and Reverse.
It's meant to just be a little on the side project as i learn to program.
# How to use
Just download one of the releases and extract it and also if you have'nt already then also install python.
Then just open your command prompt/terminal and make sure you are in the directory where you have your conversion.py file and type "python conversion.py" then hit enter and boom! That's it.
